So I was seeing my PSP and my XPERIA Play lying in front of me side-by-side on my desktop, looking at the UI that SONY gave them, and thought: "If my Play had it's own XMB, wouldn't it be cool?" and after some deeper tought, not one, but a stream of cool ideas came to my mind in that moment.
After searching the entire web looking for at least a decent or good-looking replacement for the launcher my phone came with, and found nothing that filled my expectations, and after I got some free time (yeah, college and a job absorbs a big quantity of free time) then I took the challenge, embarked in this very long journey and started coding.

If you want to test it, you need obviously, an XPERIA Play, if you want full suport.

Mine's running stock gingerbread (2.3.4), and the minimal android API was set to level 10 (2.3.3).

<b>Now, what it <i>actually</i> does?</b>
<br /><i>Does XMB-like things</i>, animations included.

<b>How to use it?</b>
<br />Right now it's locked to landscape mode so you use the Play's controller buttons to move around.

  * UP: Select previous menu subitem
  * DOWN: Select next menu subitem
  * LEFT: Select previous menu item/close submenu
  * RIGHT: Select next menu item
  * CIRCLE: Closes the side-menu, submenu or exit the launcher
  * CROSS: Execute the selected menu subitem or submenu item
  * L SHOULDER: Skip to previous track (music submenu)
  * R SHOULDER: Skip to next track (music submenu)
